# What's Up?

It occurs to me that I completely neglected to write a post about the Apple TV app I wrote last year, called [Telescope](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/telescope-nasa-astronomy-picture/id1050988587?mt=8).

The app connects to the [NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html) to download beautiful high-res space images and videos, for display on your Apple TV.

It was a fun little app to get started learning about Apple TV development, as well as my first attempt at publishing a fully-Swift app.

[Telescope is available for purchase now on the Apple TV App Store.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/telescope-nasa-astronomy-picture/id1050988587?mt=8)
